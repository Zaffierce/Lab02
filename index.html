      </h2>
      <p>I was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1995.  Raised in a military family, so from a young age I moved all over.  Once my dad retired my family moved to Washington.  I've lived in Washington State around 13 years and this is where I call home, for now.  After I graduated highschool, I went to a couple of Colleges including Washington State University and University of Arizona.  Quickly after my second school, I learned the way college was setup was not going to help me and was not beneficial for the way I learn. After I left college, I had a job in the flooring industry as a sales rep.  I was at that job for around 2 years when I started to think about a way out of that career.  It was a decent paying job but had no real challenges or opporutunity to develop a career.  Once I figured out that I needed a change, I heard about Code Fellow.  Now, I am in school trying to learn to become a great coder.</p>

      <h2>A little about my Interests</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p> When it comes to me, I'm pretty simple, I like to stay active! I love to play lacrosse, go skiing, golf, and workout. I also enjoy watching football, being around family/friends, and eating food!</p>
